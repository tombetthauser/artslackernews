# Actual Art Forum ðŸŽ¨

An art forum that's actually an art forum but has no affiliation whatsoever with art forum. Open to all but designed mainly with BFA and MFA graduates working in the visual / non-commercial arts in mind. Use it however you like or don't.

# Express Project Skeleton

Use this project skeleton as a starting point for structuring your app. Things to note

* Sequelize configuration has not yet been added -- you will need to set that up yourself
* You may find yourself wanting to use javascript -- js files can be added in `public/javascripts` and should be appended to the Pug templates as needed
* CSS files can go in `public/stylesheets` and also will need to be added to Pug templates

TOM's NOTES:

REMEMBER TO USE DOTENV with SEQUELIZE-CLI (ie...)
$ npx dotenv sequelize-cli db:create
