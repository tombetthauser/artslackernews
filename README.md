# Slacker News Arts Forum

An art forum that's actually an art forum but has no affiliation whatsoever with art forum. A loving and pointless clone of the actual website <a target="new" href="http://hackernews.org">Hacker News</a>. Open to all but designed mainly with BFA and MFA graduates working in the visual / non-commercial arts in mind. Use it however you like or don't.

Still super broken, please create new issues if you find something not working!

# Express Project Skeleton

Use this project skeleton as a starting point for structuring your app. Things to note

* Sequelize configuration has not yet been added -- you will need to set that up yourself
* You may find yourself wanting to use javascript -- js files can be added in `public/javascripts` and should be appended to the Pug templates as needed
* CSS files can go in `public/stylesheets` and also will need to be added to Pug templates

TOM's NOTES:
